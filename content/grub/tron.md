### About

This is where **TRON: Legacy** inspired Grub Theme will be. Constantly updated so keep coming back. I included a script that makes installing much easier, just follow steps below :

1- Git Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechXero/TronGrub.git
```

2- Set Exec permissions

```bash
sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
```

3- Install Theme

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

Enjoy ;)
