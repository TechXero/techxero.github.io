### About

My name's **TechXero** I also go by the handle **DarkXero**. Well I am just a *G33k* who recently got into the vast world of Linux. I am but a child in that area, so the road is still very long. I have learned so much yet so little. I wish to one day get rid of Windows never to boot into it again. That day is so close yet so farâ€¦

### Blog Site

I also have a blog site where I post all types of *Tech* related stuff from time to time. I don't post often, but when I do it's useful stuff, and sometimes I post my opinion about various *Tech* whatever it may be.. To visit [**Click Here**](https://techxero.com)

Thanks for visiting my GitHub ;)
