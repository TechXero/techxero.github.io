## Welcome to TechXero GitHub Page

This is my Github, where I will be posting all my work, like Grub Themes and Arch scripts for various distros. I am currently working on Grub Themes as well as my own Arch ISO. Will be a while before it's complete so no ETA...

I will be updating this with every new project I create.

### Who Am I ?

Well I am just a G33k who recently got into the vast world of Linux. I am but a child in that area, so the road is still very long. I have learned so much yet so little. I wish to one day get rid of Windows never to boot into it again. That day is so close yet so far...
