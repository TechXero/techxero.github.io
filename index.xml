      <description>About My name&amp;rsquo;s TechXero I also go by the handle DarkXero. Well I am just a G33k who recently got into the vast world of Linux. I am but a child in that area, so the road is still very long. I have learned so much yet so little. I wish to one day get rid of Windows never to boot into it again. That day is so close yet so farâ€¦</description>

      <description>About This is where I will be posting my custom Calamares Config. This can be used with various distros that use that installer, but mainly it was built with ArcoLinux in mind, specifically ArcoLinux Plasma. I do not know if it works with other D.E&amp;rsquo;s as I haven&amp;rsquo;t tested as of yet. I will soon, if you want you can test it and report back.
  How-To Ok, now for the &amp;ldquo;How-To Use&amp;rdquo; part of it all.</description>
